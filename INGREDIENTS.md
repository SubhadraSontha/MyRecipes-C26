The ingredients needed for this recipe are:
1. 3 tablespoons unslated butter, softened and divided
2. 1 large red bell pepper, diced
3. 1 small zucchini, diced
4. 1 jalape√±o pepper, seeded and minced
5. 1 cup broccoli florets (1/2 inch)
6. 1/4 cup water plus 2 2/3 cups, divided
7. 8 slices whole-wheat bread
8. 4 slices cheddar cheese

Now, the ingredients needed for the tomato soup are:
1. 2 tablespoons canola oil
2. 1/2 cup chopped yellow onion (I do not use onion, you can use it if you'd like, otherwise 1 small bell pepper)
3. 2 tablespoons tomato paste
4. 2 cans stewed tomatoes, undrained
5. 1 can vegetable broth
6. 1/2 teaspoon dried italian seasoning
7. 1/4 teaspoon salt, or according to your tastes
8. 1/8 teaspoon ground red pepper
9. 2/3 cup seasoned cheese and garlic croutons (I don't use garlic either, and this is optional because we're anyway eating the soup with the snadwiches)
Take your time to assemble the ingredients.
