Let's make the soup first, the soup needs to sit a bit before being consumed.
This recipe serves up to 4 servings, but you can always make more!
Here are the steps:
1. Heat oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat; add onion (if you don't use onion like me, use some other vegetable, like one small bell pepper). Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until onion is tender. Add tomato paste; cook and stir until fragrant and lightly browned.
2. Add undrained tomatoes, broth, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper to saucepan; stir to combine. Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes. Place half of tomato mixture in blender container; pulse until smooth. Repeat with remaining mixture. Top each serving with croutons (if you'd like, we have sandwiches to eat this with, so up to you).
Chef's tips:
Tomato mixture may be blended until smooth with an immersion blender in the saucepan.
Use caution when blending hot mixtures.

Now that we've done that, let's make the snadwiches!
Here are the steps:
1. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until melted and foamy. Add bell pepper, zucchini and jalapeño; cook, stirring often, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add broccoli and stir to coat. Add ¼ cup water, cover the pan and cook until the broccoli is crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl, draining off water if necessary. Wipe the pan clean.
2. Spread the remaining 2 tablespoons butter over 1 side of each bread slice. Place the bread slices, buttered-side down, in the pan. Divide the vegetables among the bread slices. Top each with a slice of cheese and a bread slice, buttered-side up. Cook over medium heat until the sandwiches are lightly browned and the cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes per side. (Cook the sandwiches in batches if they don't all fit in your skillet.)

AND THAT'S IT! YOU HAVE YOUR SANDWICHES AND SOUP! Just make sure you serve that all hot and nice, I think this is a great recipe for specifically rainy, dreary, or cold days, where you feel like locking yourself inside the house for the day.
Well, I've told you the steps, so go make a feast!
